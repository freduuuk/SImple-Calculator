# Simple Python Calculator

My **Second Python "Project"**

It's a small calculator for your PC.

It has the most useful math terms you mostly need (+,-,*,/).

It is my first GUI Programm made with tkinter

I know it's a .exe but you can see the Code on my GitHub (https://github.com/freduuuk/SImple-Calculator)

If you have questions, DM me on Discord (freduuuk#0418)
